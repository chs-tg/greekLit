title: The greekLit subnamespace for CTS URNs
layout: page
---

The Technical Working Group of the Center for Hellenic Studies maintains a registry of dentifiers used in a CTS URN subnamespace for citing works of ancient Greek literature known from manuscript transmission.  The registered abbreviation of the namespace is `greekLit`;  it resolves to the URI `http://chs.harvard.edu/ctsns/greekLit`.

Note that the `greekLit` subnamespace does *not* include works known only from papyrological or epigraphic sources, nor does it includes works known indirectly through reuse or citation in other authors ("fragments").

The registry is available as a CITE2 data collection in CEX format from the github repository <https://github.com/chs-tg/greekLit>.
