# A CTS URN subnamespace for ancient Greek literature



## Overview

In this repository, the Technical Working Group of the Center for Hellenic Studies maintains a registry for CTS URN identifiers.  The identifiers are in the  subnamespace  `http://chs.harvard.edu/ctsns/greekLit`, abbreviated  `greekLit` in the CTS URN.

The `greekLit` subnamespace is for citing works of ancient Greek literature known from manuscript transmission.  Note that it does not include works known only from papyrological or epigraphic sources, nor does it includes works known indirectly through reuse or citation in other authors (“fragments”).


## Data format and license

All data are in CEX format. The file `catalog.cex` defines the structure of the CITE2 collections.   Data for individual collections are in `greekLit-groups.cex` and `greekLit-works.cex`.

The `greekLit` subnamespace registry is in the public domain.
